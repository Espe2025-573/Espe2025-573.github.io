	<p> Having no recollection of her mother, high school outcast Maren plucks up the courage to embark on a long, challenging journey to find her during the 1980s. Instead, as Maren struggles to understand, facing her well-hidden adolescent longings on the fringes of Ronald Reagan-era America, a chance encounter with handsome soulmate Lee gives voice to the unspoken expectations of first love. Now, uneasy feelings and all-consuming impulses take over, and the raw, visceral need for companionship and connection in an indifferent society brings to light the wild side of humankind. More than anything, Maren wants to come to terms with her past to find her place in the world. But what's it like to give in to love, bones and all?</p>

		Most of the time when I mention this movie as one of my personal favorites, I’m met with disagreement and judgement. However, I do respect people’s preferences, even though it’s not meant to be looked at face value. In all honesty whenI first heard about Bones and All, I was a bit weirded out about a story heavily focused on cannibalism. As I watched the movie, I began to think deeply about how Cannibalism was used to portray different themes such as addiction, over consuming love,  acceptance of one’s own identity, and the societal rejection of marginalized communities. The cinematography and story really captivated me into liking such a disturbing story, but I think it was definitely better for viewers to watch than read the book it’s based on. Like many of Luca Guadagnino’s movies, Bones and All isn’t an exception from being looked any deeper than face value, so when watching it free yourself from judgement and enjoy it!!
