	<h1>Parasite </h1>
	
	<p> Jobless, penniless, and utterly hopeless, the unmotivated patriarch Ki-taek and his equally unambitious family struggle to make ends meet by working for peanuts in their dingy, basement-level apartment. However, their luck changes when their college-age son, Ki-woo, seizes a golden opportunity: entirely unqualified, he has the nerve to pose as an English tutor for the wealthy Park family's teenage daughter. And now, the sky is the limit. But as they adopt a winner-take-all strategy and launch a silent class war, the question arises. When it comes to parasites, how does one get rid of them?
