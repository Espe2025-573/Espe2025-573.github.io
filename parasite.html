	<p> Jobless, penniless, and utterly hopeless, the unmotivated patriarch Ki-taek and his equally unambitious family struggle to make ends meet by working for peanuts in their dingy, basement-level apartment. However, their luck changes when their college-age son, Ki-woo, seizes a golden opportunity: entirely unqualified, he has the nerve to pose as an English tutor for the wealthy Park family's teenage daughter. And now, the sky is the limit. But as they adopt a winner-take-all strategy and launch a silent class war, the question arises. When it comes to parasites, how does one get rid of them? </p>

	<p>As someone who repeatedly rewatches their favorite movies, I begin to want something else which is why when I ended up seeing Parasite used as a main example in a “Eat the Rich” slideshow on TikTok, I decided to watch it. The two common themes are how lower classes are constantly fighting each other for advantageous opportunities in higher conditions and the parasitic relationship between classes. Since the movie focuses heavily on lower and higher classes interactions, it implemented different symbols and had a setting that portrayed the contrast of daily life. He used subtle linings in the different settings and used rain, which showed how the simple weather conditions could show differences of class. For example, when it rained, the poor family’s home overflowed while it was only a bother to the rich family’s camping vacation. The simple lining in the setting showed how both classes stayed on their side, but were more apparent when the lower classes would pass the line. This is one of my favorite movies as its structered and well acted. All my praise for the movie goes to the director, Bong Joon Ho.
