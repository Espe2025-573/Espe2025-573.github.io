	<h1>Nope</h1>
	
	<p> Siblings and animal wranglers Otis and Emerald Haywood, the young proprietors of the Haywood Hollywood Horses horse-handling business, find themselves struggling to keep their family ranch afloat after the death of their father in a freak accident. Unable to make ends meet, Otis strikes a deal with troubled former child actor Ricky Park, the owner of Jupiter's Claim theme park, unaware that a storm is brewing. When Otis thinks he has a close encounter of the second kind, sheer terror turns into morbid curiosity, and without a second thought, he enlists the help of tech-savvy electronics salesperson Angel Torres and prominent cinematographer Antlers Holst to make history. However, the next time the otherworldly visitor returns, the ambitious investigators will witness first-hand its true nature.
