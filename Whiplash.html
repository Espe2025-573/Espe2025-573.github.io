		Andrew Neiman, a 19-year-old jazz drummer is determined to rise to the top of the country's most elite music conservatory. Plagued by the failed writing career of his father, Andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats. Terence Fletcher, an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man's life. Andrew's passion to achieve perfection quickly spirals into obsession, as his ruthless teacher continues to push him to the brink of both his ability and his sanity.

		 One of my favorite movie genres is the obsessed artist trope, which is why it seemed right to watch Whiplash, a story of a young man persevering through any challenge on the path for Greatness even if it means losing himself and everything he values to do so. The movie itself had been a short film previously shown at the 2013 Sundance Festival where it essentially got picked up to become the movie shown today. I believe the most enjoyable part has to be the ending, where Andrew becomes what he’s been chasing, granting Fletcher the role as a teacher of one of the greats, but ultimately leading Andrew's dad to know that he isn’t the son he once knew and never will know again. As a movie exploring the pursuit of greatness, the cost of ambition, and societal pressures to achieve success, it in all honesty, I think it has to be one of the best movies I’ve seen so far because of its pacing, cinematography, and the cast's ability to perfectly capture all the conflicting elements of the story.
