	<p> Siblings and animal wranglers Otis and Emerald Haywood, the young proprietors of the Haywood Hollywood Horses horse-handling business, find themselves struggling to keep their family ranch afloat after the death of their father in a freak accident. Unable to make ends meet, Otis strikes a deal with troubled former child actor Ricky Park, the owner of Jupiter's Claim theme park, unaware that a storm is brewing. When Otis thinks he has a close encounter of the second kind, sheer terror turns into morbid curiosity, and without a second thought, he enlists the help of tech-savvy electronics salesperson Angel Torres and prominent cinematographer Antlers Holst to make history. However, the next time the otherworldly visitor returns, the ambitious investigators will witness first-hand its true nature.</p>

		When I first heard of the release of Nope, I was super excited to see a new Jordan Peele movie! He's honestly one of the best filmmakers ever. In his movies, Get out and Us, he is able to incorporate race struggles within a horror story while also highlighting a more broad message. For Nope, he focused on the exploitation of wildlife through the alien due to being blinded for fame which is consistent throughout the movie. My favorite message however is the commodification of trauma in order to achieve the American dream. Through the alien and Steven Yuenâ€™s character, these two messages really blend in together and create a perfect combination of horror, sci-fi, and comedy. Personally, he leaves so many easter eggs, so every time i rewatch it, i see something new.
